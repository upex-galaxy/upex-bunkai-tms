This file is the per-session compact-rules cache for the Skill Resolver protocol.
The orchestrator copies one or more `## Skill: <slug>` blocks below into every subagent briefing under `## Project Standards (auto-resolved)`.
Subagents trust those compact rules and only read the full SKILL.md when explicitly instructed.

## Skill: acli

**Purpose**: Atlassian CLI (official `acli` binary, v1.3+ as of 2026) for Jira Cloud, Confluence Cloud, and org admin tasks from the terminal.

**Compact Rules**:
- **Silent pagination truncation.** `workitem search` without `--paginate` returns the first page only — no warning. Scripts that count or iterate keys read the wrong number of items.
- **Auth is per-product.** `acli jira auth login` does not authenticate `acli admin`, `acli confluence`, or `acli rovodev`. There is also a top-level `acli auth` for global OAuth (newer surface). Each scope has its own session.
- **The "work item" vs "issue" split.** The CLI renamed commands (`jira issue` → `jira workitem`) but the JSON response still has a top-level `issues[]` array and CSV inputs still use `issueType`/`parentIssueId` spellings. Mixing old and new terminology in the same script works, but confuses readers.
- **Unknown subcommands fail silently.** Typing `acli jira workflow --help` does NOT error — it falls back to `acli jira --help` with exit 0. So "no error" ≠ "command exists". Always verify by checking the help body actually changed.
- **Hard limits the docs do not advertise.** `acli` cannot list custom fields, edit custom-field values on existing items, manage workflows, manage issue types, or touch project versions/components. See `references/gotchas.md`.
- Read `complementary_categories` from this skill's frontmatter (`issue-tracker`).
- Resolve via the host repo's skill-registry cache (`.claude/skills/REGISTRY.md`, built by `scripts/build-skill-registry.ts`). Fallback: scan the session-start `system-reminder` skill list.
- Apply the threshold rule per the host repo's skill-composition strategy doc (T1 / T3 silent; T4 ASK).
- The Atlassian MCP fallback documented below is OPT-IN, not a skill — enable manually via `docs/mcp/`.
- `acli` binary is not installed in the environment.
- `acli` auth fails and cannot be fixed in the current session.
- The operation is one of the documented `acli` blind spots: enumerate custom fields, edit custom-field values on existing work items, manage workflows / issue types / priorities / resolutions / project versions / components, upload attachments, add watchers, add an item to a sprint.
- Bulk operations (acli consumes far fewer tokens per call).
- Scripting / CI pipelines.
- Operations that return large result sets (MCP payloads inflate token usage).
- (truncated — read full SKILL.md for the rest)

**Read full SKILL.md when**: the compact rules above are insufficient (e.g. novel scenario, debugging, or the briefing tells you to load the full skill).

## Skill: agentic-dev-core

**Purpose**: Foundation skill that hosts shared references cited by other workflow skills (briefing template, dispatch patterns, orchestration doctrin...

**Compact Rules**:
- agentic-dev-core/references/briefing-template.md
- agentic-dev-core/references/dispatch-patterns.md
- Read `complementary_categories` from this skill's frontmatter (`language`).
- Resolve via local skill-registry script (`scripts/build-skill-registry.ts` → cached at `.claude/skills/REGISTRY.md`). Fallback: scan the session-start `system-reminder` skill list.
- For each matched skill, classify tier per strategy doc §2.
- Apply threshold rule per strategy doc §3.2:
- **T1 / T3** matches → load silently. Cache for the session.
- **T4** matches → ASK user once: `"Detected <skill> (T4). Apply when consulting agentic-dev-core/references/typescript-patterns.md? Y/N"`. Cache the answer for the session.
- When dispatching sub-agents that consume `references/typescript-patterns.md`, inject a `## Composable Skills` block per strategy doc §6.2.
- Provide a bootstrap or init action — clone the full repo instead.
- Create or modify any files. It is a passive reference library.
- Create or modify `.context/` files (that belongs to `/agentic-dev-onboard` and `/project-foundation`).
- Generate or scaffold tests, fixtures, or test components (that belongs to `/unit-testing` and test-automation skills).
- Adapt the framework to a specific stack (that belongs to `/project-bootstrap`).
- Sync project-specific facts in `CLAUDE.md` (that belongs to `/sync-ai-memory`).

- **§1 CRITICAL RULES** — 14 rules that override defaults (credentials, plan-before-coding, no AI attribution, MCP credential failure protocol, `READ package.json DIRECTLY`, UI fidelity contract).
- **§4 CONTEXT LOADING MAP** — task → trigger phrase → skill → context files → primary tool.
- **§5 SKILLS + COMMANDS + MCPs REGISTRY** — full T1/T3/T4 skill model.

## Skill: autonomous-delivery

**Purpose**: SCHEDULED entry point for a delivery run.

**Compact Rules**:
- **Git is the source of truth; the tracker is a hint.** A ticket shipped only when `git merge-base --is-ancestor <mergeCommit> <integration-branch>` succeeds. A status of ready-for-QA, done, or merged proves nothing — merge automation commonly fires on ANY pull request merge, including a chain's internal ones. Never advance a dependency on a status flip.
- **`git fetch` immediately before every ancestor or fast-forward check, unconditionally.** A merge performed through the host's API updates the real ref at once; your remote-tracking ref updates only on the next fetch. "I fetched a few minutes ago" has produced a confident, wrong answer.
- **One lock per mode, never a queue.** A live lock for your mode means another run owns it: exit cleanly with a report. Do not wait, do not queue, do not run anyway. A lock older than `lock_staleness_minutes` is abandoned — reclaim it and log the reclamation.
- **Product questions are DECIDED, never escalated (`CLAUDE.md` Rule #18).** This project has no human PO — an open product, business, functional, scope, UX-copy or design-intent question on a ticket is work to do, not a blocker. **Search the record FIRST** (`.session/autonomous-delivery/escalation-log.md` in full, `.context/ADR/`, the ticket's siblings) — a ruling that already governs it is followed and cited, never re-derived. Only if genuinely unsettled, dispatch a decision subagent (`AI Product Owner / Business Analyst`, `AI Tech Lead`, or both when joint, `model: "opus"` explicit), have it score 2-4 candidate answers against explicit criteria, publish the winner to the ticket under an attributed heading (`## AI Product Owner — Decision: <question>`), resync the cache, and CONTINUE. Never style an AI ruling as human sign-off, and never leave one unattributed. Escalate ONLY a genuinely new security posture, and whatever the operator explicitly reserved — `migrations: unrestricted` removed the destructive-migration gate as an escalation source, so that category is gone too. See `decision-protocol.md` §5.1.
- **An escalation nobody is told about is indistinguishable from a run that silently died.** For `story`/`bug` mode, the clean-stop sequence's notification step is two calls, not one, in this order: first `slack_send_message` to `escalation_channel` (`.agents/project.yaml`) — the PRIMARY path, an external channel that persists and needs no connected client or Remote Control — naming the ticket key, what is blocking it, and what the operator needs to decide; then `PushNotification` (`status: "proactive"`, message under 200 characters, one line, no markdown, leading with the ticket key and the actual decision needed) — the SECONDARY path. Both are REQUIRED, after the lock releases and before the run ends. A Slack send failure does not skip the `PushNotification`, does not skip the escalation-log entry, and does not stop the run from ending cleanly — record the send failure in the run report. Never end an escalated run without at least attempting both.
- **`escalation_channel` carries escalations only, never run summaries.** A run that finishes cleanly does not post there. An empty run — nothing eligible — does not post there either; that is a correct outcome and it goes to the run report, same as always. Anything landing in `#claude-routine-blockers` is by definition something the operator must act on, and that property is what makes the channel worth reading.
- **Exactly two things legitimately block a candidate**, and an empty run is only correct when one of them is what you actually found: (a) a **real dependency** — the prerequisite is not an ancestor of the integration branch, verified by git, never by a status; (b) **a story that never went through shift-left at all** — a QA-authoring gap, recorded for assignment, never invented yourself. An unresolved or self-ratified refinement question is category (a) for neither: it is a decision to dispatch. Selecting marginal work to avoid an empty report is still a failure — but so is reporting empty over a question you were equipped to settle.
- **Caps are hard: `story` 1 per run, `bug` 3 sequential (each fully closed before the next), `discovery` up to 2 new user stories per run (never application code, and only after its synchronous approval gate — see Autonomy).** Every measured story became a multi-thousand-line chain; two do not fit in one run's context.
- **Write the handoff as you go, never at the end.** A run that exhausts its context cannot write up why. Checkpoint after every phase and after every completed slice.
- **When context runs low, push the branch FIRST, then record resume state, then stop.** Unpushed commits in a disposable worktree are the only unrecoverable loss in this system. A clean mid-work handoff is a success; a mid-ticket death with unpushed work is the failure to design against.
- **Applying a schema migration to shared infrastructure is irreversible and hits every concurrent agent.** Under `migrations: confirm` (default) it stops for approval, stating target and additive-vs-destructive. Under `migrations: autonomous` it proceeds for ADDITIVE changes only and still stops for anything that drops, renames, or rewrites a live object. Under `migrations: unrestricted` it proceeds for EVERY class, including destructive ones — this project's current setting (operator decision, 2026-08-06; see Configuration). Writing the migration file is always autonomous; applying it is not. Two rules bind at every level, `unrestricted` included: never apply a migration merely to clear a local error, and always re-read the live definition after every apply (incl. re-applies) and diff it against the committed file.
- **A cached `gh` identity can silently flip between phases in a multi-account setup.** `gh auth status` showing the correct account (with repo write/merge scope) at Phase 0 is not evidence it is still active at merge time — `git push` keeps working under a separate keychain credential even after the active `gh` account changes, so the failure surfaces only at `gh pr merge`, looking like a permissions or branch-protection error. Assert the expected account (`autonomous_delivery.automation_gh_account` in `.agents/project.yaml`) and `gh auth switch --user <account>` if it drifted — at Phase 0, again immediately before the first push, and again immediately before any merge.
- **Take the migration number from the live ledger immediately before writing the file**, never from a local directory listing. The ledger can be ahead of your branch by a peer's unmerged migration, and behind no file you can list.
- **Read regenerated output before committing it.** Types, clients, and API specs generated from a shared live instance silently absorb a concurrent sibling's unmerged schema. Diff it; strip foreign entries after proving zero consumers.
- **Give every dispatched agent its own worktree.** A background subagent writes into its dispatcher's working directory by default, outlives its dispatcher, and keeps mutating shared state after the dispatcher is gone. Fixing this after `git status` looks wrong is too late.

## Skill: design-system

**Purpose**: Genera un DESIGN.md (formato Google Labs Apache-2.0) en el root del proyecto antes del scaffolding del frontend.

**Compact Rules**:
- `agentic-dev-core/references/briefing-template.md` — used when dispatching to a subagent (Open Design or Claude Design handoff conversion).
- `agentic-dev-core/references/dispatch-patterns.md` — selects Single / Sequential / Parallel for the chosen path.
- `agentic-dev-core/references/orchestration-doctrine.md` — mandatory subagent dispatch (main thread is command center).
- `agentic-dev-core/references/session-management.md` — Phase 0 resume contract, plan-first persistence at `.session/design-system/`, archive on completion.
- `.context/business/business-model.md` — industria, value-prop, tone implícito.
- `.context/PRD/personas.md` — target visual, demographic signal.
- `.context/PRD/executive-summary.md` — positioning, success KPIs.
- Read `complementary_categories` from this skill's frontmatter (`frontend-ui`, `accessibility`).
- Resolve via local skill-registry script (`scripts/build-skill-registry.ts` → cached at `.claude/skills/REGISTRY.md`). Fallback: scan the session-start `system-reminder` skill list.
- For each matched skill, classify tier per strategy doc §2.
- Apply threshold rule per strategy doc §3.2:
- **T1 / T3** matches → load silently. Cache for the session.
- **T4** matches → ASK user once: `"Detected <skill> (T4). Apply for this design-system work? Y/N"`. Cache the answer for the session.
- When dispatching sub-agents (Open Design conversion, Claude Design handoff, LLM-authored custom DESIGN.md), inject a `## Composable Skills` block per strategy doc §6.2.
- A new project just finished the PRD and needs to define visual identity before the SRS architecture phase.

## Skill: git-flow-master

**Purpose**: End-to-end Git operator for any branching strategy.

**Compact Rules**:
- **Read the repo state first (Step 1).** Never assume branch, upstream, or cleanliness.
- **The strategy comes from `.agents/project.yaml` → `git_strategy`**, read per invocation. Never infer it from a skill example or from another project.
- **`policy:` records INTENT, not enforcement.** Reconcile it against the host once per session at the first push / PR / merge intent (Step 1b), then stamp `meta.policy_verified` / `meta.policy_source`. Never state what the remote requires from a `declared` reading — say "declared, not verified".
- **Query BOTH GitHub protection mechanisms.** `branches/{b}/protection` (classic) AND `rules/branches/{b}` (rulesets). A `404` on the classic endpoint does NOT mean unprotected — rulesets enforce PR requirements invisibly to it. A push that succeeds is not proof a rule is absent: admins bypass rulesets while the rule still binds everyone else.
- **Report drift, never auto-correct it.** A mismatch between `policy:` and host protection is surfaced with both values and three options; editing `.agents/project.yaml` needs the user's choice.
- **Config examples in `references/` are examples.** Quoting one as a project's real configuration is a defect. Open the project's own file and cite it.
- **The chained-PR decision travels with its trace.** Return `Chain strategy` + `Decision trace` (verbatim tree answers, each with the reason from this change) + `Decided by`. Callers reject a bare label. This skill is the ONLY authority that may fill those lines.
- **Never push to `main` without explicit confirmation**; honour `direct_push_to_protected` on every protected branch.
- **Never** `--force`, `--force-with-lease`, `--no-verify`, amend, or rebase pushed history on a shared branch unless the user explicitly asks AND the branch is unshared.
- **Admin bypass may only be OFFERED when `admin_bypass: true`**, and only after re-confirming at runtime that the operator really is an admin and that they accept the specific irreversible action.
- **Stop at PR creation.** Never auto-merge.
- **One commit = one responsibility**, conventional prefix, no AI-attribution lines.

**Read full SKILL.md when**: running Strategy Setup, resolving conflicts, planning a chain, or when the compact rules above do not settle the operation.

## Skill: product-management

**Purpose**: Orchestrates continuous product management work — initial backlog seed from PRD, incremental feature addition, epic creation, story refin...

**Compact Rules**:
- A new feature or epic needs to be added to the backlog
- A story has rough or ambiguous acceptance criteria that need sharpening
- A story needs INVEST validation or a 3-amigos session before development starts
- You're systematically enumerating edge cases / failure modes for a feature
- You're seeding the very first product backlog from a freshly minted PRD
- `/project-foundation` should have produced `.context/PRD/` and `.context/SRS/` (required for the initial backlog-seed workflow; useful context for all others)
- `.agents/project.yaml` populated with `{{PROJECT_KEY}}`, `{{ISSUE_TRACKER}}`, `{{ATLASSIAN_URL}}` — these ship with the cloned boilerplate; if missing, clone the full repo
- Atlassian / Jira tooling reachable (Atlassian CLI `acli` preferred, MCP Atlassian as fallback) for any workflow that writes to Jira
- `.agents/project.yaml` — project identity, env URLs, project key, MCP names.
- `.agents/jira-required.yaml` — canonical slug catalog (fields + statuses + link types).
- `.agents/jira-fields.json` — slug → numeric custom-field-ID mapping.
- `.agents/jira-workflows.json` — workflow + transition catalog.
- `.agents/jira-link-types.json` — slug → workspace link-type mapping (when present).
- `.context/master-implementation-plan.md` — Master Sprint roadmap.
- `.context/PRD/mvp-scope.md` — what's in vs out of the MVP.
- (truncated — read full SKILL.md for the rest)

## Skill: project-bootstrap

**Purpose**: Scaffolds the technical infrastructure of a new project: backend (DB schemas, API base, types, error handling), frontend (design system,...

**Compact Rules**:
- `agentic-dev-core/references/briefing-template.md` — used when dispatching parallel scaffolding subagents (e.g. backend + frontend in parallel).
- `agentic-dev-core/references/dispatch-patterns.md` — picks Single / Sequential / Parallel for each phase below.
- `agentic-dev-core/references/skill-composition-strategy.md` — composition contract consumed by the step below.
- `agentic-dev-core/references/orchestration-doctrine.md` — mandatory subagent dispatch (main thread is command center).
- `agentic-dev-core/references/session-management.md` — Phase 0 resume contract, plan-first persistence at `.session/project-bootstrap/`, archive on completion.
- Read `complementary_categories` from this skill's frontmatter (`frontend-framework`, `frontend-ui`, `backend-db`, `runtime`, `language`, `ci-cd`).
- Resolve via local skill-registry script (`scripts/build-skill-registry.ts` → cached at `.claude/skills/REGISTRY.md`). Fallback: scan the session-start `system-reminder` skill list.
- For each matched skill, classify tier per strategy doc §2 (path-based: `.claude/skills/` → T1; PROJECT_LEVEL_SKILLS → T3; USER_LEVEL_SKILLS → T4).
- Apply threshold rule per strategy doc §3.2:
- **T1 / T3** matches → load silently. Cache for the session.
- **T4** matches → ASK user once: `"Detected <skill> (T4). Apply for this bootstrap? Y/N"`. Cache the answer for the session.
- When dispatching scaffolding sub-agents (Backend setup, Frontend setup, Incremental features), inject a `## Composable Skills` block per strategy doc §6.2 listing the resolved skills + project standards (test command, runtime, etc).
- A fresh repo has its product foundation (`/project-foundation` already ran) but no code yet.
- An existing repo needs an incremental infrastructure feature added (e.g. "add OpenAPI to the API", "add bearer auth", "wire Supabase types into the frontend").
- Define the product (PRD, user journeys, architecture decisions) — that's `/project-foundation`.

**Compact Rules**:
- `agentic-dev-core/references/briefing-template.md` — used when dispatching subagents to research market data, audit competitors, or interview users.

- When dispatching sub-agents (Constitution, PRD, SRS, Discovery), inject a `## Composable Skills` block per strategy doc §6.2.
- Stakeholder brief or initial PRD draft — whatever the user provides as the seed for this foundation pass (paste, doc link, voice-memo transcript, etc.).
- `.context/PRD/` — existing PRD outputs if a prior version exists. UPSERT semantics: re-invoking a phase refines what's there; it does NOT rewrite from scratch.

## Skill: sprint-development

**Purpose**: Orchestrates the per-story dev loop end-to-end: Planning -> Implementation -> Code Review -> Staging deploy -> (gated) Production deploy.

**Compact Rules**:
- **Automation identity is declared, never chosen.** Log into a running app ONLY as the account named in `.agents/project.yaml` → `testing.automation_identity` (variable NAMES there, values in `.env`). Slot unset or variable missing → STOP and report; never substitute another account, query the DB for one, create one, or reuse the human's browser session. See `references/live-ui-identity.md`.
- **Never bypass the app's own login path.** No service-role / secret / admin keys, no admin user-management APIs (list / create / mutate users), no generated magic or password-reset links, no locally-signed JWTs, no hand-crafted session cookies, no impersonation of any account — including "just to see the admin view". Surface the need as a finding instead.
- **Session material is ephemeral.** Cookie jars, `storageState.json`, token files, `.har` captures: session scratch directory only (never the repo tree), deleted BEFORE reporting, disclosed as `secrets_materialized:` + `cleaned:` in the report. Never echo a credential into a report, plan, commit, PR body, or tracker comment.
- **Live-UI validation is browser-based at the gate.** A UI story cannot be approved on HTTP-probe evidence alone; Tier 0 probes carry the inner loop and non-visual assertions only (`references/live-ui-validation.md` §7). Never validate against a production build.
- **A DEFINER function's `WHERE` clause is not authorization.** `SECURITY DEFINER` bypasses RLS unless the table declares `FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY` (verify for your schema; never assume it), so a filter on a caller-supplied identity or scope parameter selects rows — it does not decide who may ask. Writing or changing such a function requires BOTH an actor bind at step 0 (`if auth.uid() is not null and auth.uid() <> p_actor_user_id then raise ... errcode 'P0002'`) AND explicit scoping of every returned row; asserting the caller's own membership does NOT scope the result set. First ask whether `SECURITY INVOKER` — or deleting the identity parameter — removes the class instead. Prove it with a DB-integration test that attempts the spoof against the real database: a mocked `db.rpc` proves nothing. See `references/rpc-authorization.md`.
- **The workload forecast gate is fail-closed.** With `risk = High`, `Chain strategy` is accepted ONLY with a verbatim `Decision trace:` citing the git-flow-master chained-PR tree answers. Missing or malformed trace is treated as `pending` and blocks Stage 2. The planner may only emit `pending` — it never picks a strategy itself.
- **Ticket availability is queried, never read from prose.** Before planning or recommending a ticket, query the tracker live for that ticket and its direct blockers. `.context/dev-roadmap.md` is authoritative for dependency edges and mockup gates, never for current status — a recent timestamp on that file says nothing about a ticket's status today.
- **Config claims cite the file they came from.** Read `.agents/project.yaml` / `package.json` / `.env.example` before asserting what the project is configured to do. Never quote a value from a skill reference or worked example as project state.
- **Technical decisions are yours to make — but read the record before you make one.** Search the run's decision/escalation log, `.context/ADR/`, and the ticket plus its siblings BEFORE deciding OR asking. A decision already made is followed and cited, never re-derived; re-asking a settled question — even to a human, asked cold without the prior ruling in front of them — yields a contradiction, not an override. Genuinely unsettled and technical → decide it yourself via a scored judge panel of 3-5 independent lenses, then record the decision AND its scoring rationale where the next agent's search will find it. **Genuinely unsettled and PRODUCT/business/functional → also yours** (`CLAUDE.md` Rule #18 — this project has no human PO): dispatch an `AI Product Owner / Business Analyst` subagent (or `AI Tech Lead`, or both when joint), have it score 2-4 candidate answers, and publish the ruling to the ticket under an attributed heading (`## AI Product Owner — Decision: <question>`), then resync the cache. Escalate ONLY a novel security posture not already ratified, irreversible or destructive actions, and whatever the operator explicitly reserved. See `agentic-dev-core/references/decision-protocol.md` §5.1.
- **Plan before code.** Stage 1 always runs; even a bug fix gets a one-paragraph root-cause analysis before the diff.
- **Verification cap=3**: lint + types + unit tests in parallel; green before any push.
- **Atomic commits**, semantic prefixes, no AI-attribution lines, never `--no-verify`, never force-push a pushed branch, never push to `main` without explicit confirmation.
- **Scope discipline**: touch only what the story states. No "while I'm here" refactors.
- **Reviewer findings are adjudicated**, not auto-applied: each is verified against the diff + AC, or dismissed with a one-line reason.

**Read full SKILL.md when**: the stage you are running needs its full walkthrough, a gate fires, or the briefing tells you to load the full skill.

## Skill: testability-guide

**Purpose**: Generates a public in-app `/qa` page ("Software Testability Guide for QA") + a tool-agnostic credentials artifact (markdown body) the use...

**Compact Rules**:
- **A public `/qa` page inside the app** titled _"Software Testability Guide for QA"_ — explains the architecture, demo users, DB-level testing via DBHub MCP, API-level testing via OpenAPI MCP, UI-level testing via Playwright (scripted and agentic). The page links out to the real credentials but never inlines them.
- **A tool-agnostic credentials artifact** (a markdown body) that holds the real DB connection, API login, demo passwords, OpenAPI spec URL, and Swagger UI link. The user picks where this artifact gets published: a Jira Epic (default), a Confluence page, a Notion page, any tool reachable via an MCP or a CLI, or — as a last resort — manual paste.
- `.agents/project.yaml` — project identity, env URLs, default branch, MCP names.
- `.mcp.json` — available MCP servers (Atlassian, Notion, etc.). Determines which publisher targets are reachable.
- `app/qa/page.tsx` snapshot (or framework-equivalent location) when present — current state of the `/qa` page; needed for the idempotency / drift-detection check (Phase 2).
- The publisher target's API contract — varies by Q1 answer: Jira Epic via `[ISSUE_TRACKER_TOOL]`, Confluence page via `[KNOWLEDGE_BASE_TOOL]`, Notion page via Notion MCP, generic MCP / CLI per `references/publishers/`.
- `.env.example` — to know which credentials slots the credentials artifact should reference by name (NEVER quote the actual values).
- `agentic-dev-core/references/briefing-template.md` — used when dispatching parallel sub-agents (e.g. page codegen + credentials-artifact publish in parallel).
- `agentic-dev-core/references/dispatch-patterns.md` — picks Single / Sequential / Parallel for each phase.
- `agentic-dev-core/references/skill-composition-strategy.md` — composition contract consumed by the auto-resolve step below.
- `agentic-dev-core/references/orchestration-doctrine.md` — mandatory subagent dispatch (main thread is command center).
- `agentic-dev-core/references/session-management.md` — Phase 0 resume contract, plan-first persistence at `.session/testability-guide/`, archive on completion.
- Read `complementary_categories` from this skill's frontmatter.
- Resolve via local skill-registry script (`scripts/build-skill-registry.ts` → cached at `.claude/skills/REGISTRY.md`). Fallback: scan the session-start `system-reminder` skill list.
- Classify tier per strategy doc §2.

## Skill: unit-testing

**Purpose**: Focused skill for unit-test design — TDD workflow (red-green-refactor), test naming (AAA, Given-When-Then), mocking patterns (mocks/spies...

**Compact Rules**:
- "Write unit tests for this function/class"
- "TDD this slice" / "red-green-refactor"
- "What should I mock here?"
- "How do I name this test?"
- "What's the right coverage target for this module?"
- Mid-flight from `/sprint-development` Stage 2 (Implementation) when implementing TDD-friendly code (pure functions, complex branching, bug fix reproducers)
- Project has a unit test runner configured (Jest, Vitest, Mocha, or similar)
- Test command exists in `package.json` (`bun test`, `npm test`, `vitest`, etc.)
- For TDD: test runner supports watch mode (`--watch`)
- If no runner is configured, the first task is to set one up — see `references/unit-testing.md` § Setup
- The function / module under test — read its public interface first; that's the contract the tests must lock in.
- Existing tests for the same module (sibling `*.test.ts` / `*.spec.ts` in the same folder) — extend, don't duplicate.
- The function's callers (search by symbol) — informs which collaborators are external (mock) vs internal (use real).
- Test framework config (`vitest.config.ts` / `jest.config.ts` / equivalent) — env vars, setup files, coverage thresholds, path aliases.
- Test helpers / fixtures used by sibling tests in the same folder — reuse the project's seams instead of inventing parallel ones.

## Skill: vercel-cli

**Purpose**: Vercel CLI cookbook for this Next.js + Supabase + Vercel boilerplate.

**Compact Rules**:
- **`vercel ls | grep` is the wrong tool to check whether YOUR deploy is ready.** ANSI color codes break the regex, and the output mixes new and old deploys for the same branch. The canonical "is this exact commit deployed" question has a different answer: `vercel ls -m githubCommitSha=<sha> --format json` to find the URL, then `vercel inspect <url> --wait --timeout=10m` to block until terminal state.
- **`vercel deploy` blocks by default; `vercel inspect` does NOT.** That asymmetry is backwards from intuition and trips agents constantly. Rule: **always pass `--no-wait` to `vercel deploy`** (return URL immediately), **always pass `--wait` to `vercel inspect`** (block until READY / ERROR / CANCELED). See `references/gotchas.md`.
- **Env-var scopes are not the same string in the CLI and the dashboard.** CLI uses lowercase `production` / `preview` / `development`; the dashboard shows "Production" / "Preview" / "Development". The CLI is the authoritative spelling — if you need to script env mutations, use the CLI form.
- Read `complementary_categories` from this skill's frontmatter (`deploy-vercel`).
- Look up the local skill-registry script (`scripts/build-skill-registry.ts` → `.claude/skills/REGISTRY.md`). Fallback: scan the session-start `system-reminder` skill list.
- If `/deploy-to-vercel` is installed (default project-level community skill per `cli/install.ts`), prefer it for any "I haven't deployed this project yet" intent.
- **`--no-wait` on deploy, `--wait` on inspect — never the other way around.** Inverting these means you either block for 10 minutes waiting on a deploy URL you needed immediately, or you race an unfinished deployment with a smoke test.
- **`vercel ls -m githubCommitSha=<sha>` is the canonical "find MY deploy" query.** No grep, no parsing, no race. Use `--format json` and `jq`.
- **Status filter values are UPPERCASE.** `vercel ls --status READY` works; `--status ready` returns empty with no error.
- **`vercel env pull` writes to `.env.local` by default.** That file is in `.gitignore` for a reason — never commit it. If you need a different filename, pass it as a positional arg.
- **Multi-team accounts need `--scope <team-slug>` on EVERY mutating command.** Otherwise the operation hits the wrong team's project, or fails with a confusing 404.
- **Always `--format json`** on `ls`, `env ls`, `teams ls`. Human tables include ANSI color and lose columns at narrow widths.
- **Always `--no-wait` on `vercel deploy`** in scripts. Capture the URL, then poll with `vercel inspect --wait` separately.
- **Always `--wait --timeout=10m`** on `vercel inspect` when verifying. Default behavior returns immediately with whatever state the deploy is currently in — usually `BUILDING`, which tells you nothing.
- **Always pass `--scope <team-slug>`** if `vercel teams ls` shows more than one team. If the project is already linked, the `orgId` in `.vercel/project.json` / `.vercel/repo.json` resolves the team automatically and you can omit `--scope`.
