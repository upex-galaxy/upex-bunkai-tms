# Atlassian CLI (`acli`)

`acli` is Atlassian's official command-line tool for Jira Cloud, Confluence Cloud, and org admin operations. In this DEV boilerplate it serves as the primary `[ISSUE_TRACKER_TOOL]` — see `CLAUDE.md` Tool Resolution table. The Atlassian MCP server is OPT-IN (not enabled by default) and documented as a fallback in docs/mcp/ for users who choose to install it manually.

This skill teaches how to drive `acli` for any DEV intent: fetching story details for an implementation plan, transitioning a ticket through the Ready For Dev → In Progress → In Review → Ready For QA workflow, creating bugs from inside `/sprint-development`, linking PRs to stories, and scripted/CI Jira automation.

## Why this skill exists

`acli` has several traits that make it easy to misuse:

1. **Silent pagination truncation.** `workitem search` without `--paginate` returns the first page only — no warning. Scripts that count or iterate keys read the wrong number of items.
2. **Auth is per-product.** `acli jira auth login` does not authenticate `acli admin`, `acli confluence`, or `acli rovodev`. There is also a top-level `acli auth` for global OAuth (newer surface). Each scope has its own session.
3. **The "work item" vs "issue" split.** The CLI renamed commands (`jira issue` → `jira workitem`) but the JSON response still has a top-level `issues[]` array and CSV inputs still use `issueType`/`parentIssueId` spellings. Mixing old and new terminology in the same script works, but confuses readers.
4. **Unknown subcommands fail silently.** Typing `acli jira workflow --help` does NOT error — it falls back to `acli jira --help` with exit 0. So "no error" ≠ "command exists". Always verify by checking the help body actually changed.
5. **Hard limits the docs do not advertise.** `acli` cannot list custom fields, edit custom-field values on existing items, manage workflows, manage issue types, or touch project versions/components. See `references/gotchas.md`.

The body below covers the core that applies to almost every DEV session. The `references/` directory holds the deep material — load only the one you need.

## Composable Skills (auto-resolved at skill entry)

`acli` is itself the canonical issue-tracker skill — there are no T3 skills that overlap its category in `.claude/skills/agentic-dev-core/references/skill-composition-strategy.md` §5.1. Composition is therefore minimal and exists for protocol consistency only.

Steps:

1. Read `complementary_categories` from this skill's frontmatter (`issue-tracker`).
2. Resolve via local skill-registry script (`scripts/build-skill-registry.ts` → cached at `.claude/skills/REGISTRY.md`). Fallback: scan the session-start `system-reminder` skill list.
3. Apply threshold rule per strategy doc §3.2 (T1/T3 silent; T4 ASK).
4. The Atlassian MCP fallback documented below is OPT-IN, not a skill — enable manually via docs/mcp/.

Expected matches: typically none. If the user has installed a future T4 skill in the `issue-tracker` category (e.g. an `acli` extension authored by a third party), it would surface here under the ASK rule.

Skip step if the catalog is unavailable; log `skill_resolution: "fallback-inline"` plus `missing: [<categories>]` per §3.4.

## Fallback: Atlassian MCP

> **Opt-in only**: this MCP is NOT enabled in the default boilerplate. To use it, copy the atlassian block from `docs/mcp/<agent>.template.*` into `.mcp.json` / `opencode.jsonc`, ensure `ATLASSIAN_*` in `.env` are set, and restart the agent. Behavior below applies only after opt-in.

If `acli` is not installed or authenticated, fall back to the Atlassian MCP server (MCP tool namespace: `mcp__atlassian__*` or similar — check the MCP tool list for the exact prefix in the current environment).

**When to prefer MCP over acli**:

- `acli` binary is not installed in the environment.
- `acli` auth fails and cannot be fixed in the current session.
- The operation is one of the documented `acli` blind spots: enumerate custom fields, edit custom-field values on existing work items, manage workflows / issue types / priorities / resolutions / project versions / components, upload attachments, add watchers, add an item to a sprint.

**When to prefer acli over MCP**:

- Bulk operations (acli consumes far fewer tokens per call).
- Scripting / CI pipelines.
- Operations that return large result sets (MCP payloads inflate token usage).

**Coverage parity**: MCP and `acli` overlap for issues, projects, boards, sprints, comments, and basic Confluence ops. For org-admin user lifecycle and Confluence space CRUD, `acli` is more direct. For schema/admin reads (field catalog, workflow definitions), MCP/REST is the only viable path.

## Role inside the DEV workflow

This skill complements the `/sprint-development` mega-orchestrator. It does NOT drive the sprint loop — it is the underlying CLI surface that `/sprint-development` and other DEV skills call when they need to talk to Jira:

| DEV moment                                                                          | What this skill does                                                                            |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/sprint-development` Stage 1 (Planning) — fetch ticket                             | `acli jira workitem view UPEX-123 --json` → ACs, Gherkin, Scope, Mockup, Workflow custom fields |
| `/sprint-development` Stage 1 — transition story to In Progress                     | `acli jira workitem transition --key UPEX-123 --status "{{jira.status.story.in_progress}}"`     |
| `/sprint-development` Stage 3 (Code Review) — transition to In Review               | `acli jira workitem transition --key UPEX-123 --status "{{jira.status.story.in_review}}"`       |
| `/sprint-development` Stage 4 — handoff to QA                                       | `acli jira workitem transition --key UPEX-123 --status "{{jira.status.story.ready_for_qa}}"`    |
| `/sprint-development` Stage 3 — found a defect mid-implementation                   | `acli jira workitem create --project UPEX --type Bug --summary "..." --parent UPEX-123`         |
| Linking the merged PR back to the ticket                                            | `acli jira workitem link create --out UPEX-123 --in <pr-issue-or-remote-link>`                  |
| `/product-management` — bulk-create stories from a CSV                              | `acli jira workitem create-bulk --from-csv stories.csv --yes`                                   |
| `/product-management` (workflow G) — pull all in-flight stories for a sprint report | `acli jira workitem search --jql "..." --paginate --json`                                       |

Issue types DEV cares about: **Story**, **Bug**, **Task**, **Epic**. Test-management issue types live in the sister QA repo and are not handled here.

## Command structure

```

```

| Product      | Purpose                                                                                           |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `jira`       | Jira Cloud — work items, projects, boards, sprints, filters, dashboards, custom-field definitions |
| `confluence` | Confluence Cloud — spaces (CRUD), blog posts, page view                                           |
| `admin`      | Organization admin — API-key auth, user lifecycle                                                 |
| `auth`       | Global OAuth (cross-product, newer top-level surface)                                             |

Every level has `--help`. Use it aggressively when unsure:

```bash
acli --help
acli jira --help
acli jira workitem --help
acli jira workitem create --help
```

## Quick start (DEV flow)

```bash
# 1. Authenticate against a site using an API token (scriptable path)
echo "$ATLASSIAN_API_TOKEN" | acli jira auth login \
  --site "{{ATLASSIAN_SITE}}" \
  --email "you@example.com" \
  --token

# 2. Verify
acli jira auth status

# 3. Fetch the story you are about to implement (impl-plan input)
acli jira workitem view UPEX-123 --json | jq '.fields | {summary, status, assignee, customfield_acceptance_criteria_gherkin}'

# 4. Move it into "In Progress" when /sprint-development Stage 1 starts
acli jira workitem transition --key UPEX-123 --status "{{jira.status.story.in_progress}}"

# 5. Search for everything you own that is still open (sprint dashboard)
acli jira workitem search \
  --jql "assignee = currentUser() AND status in ('Ready For Dev','In Progress','In Review')" \
  --paginate --json
```

| `user`     | activate · deactivate · delete · cancel-delete |

## The selector pattern (the thing to internalize)

Most mutating `workitem` commands (`edit`, `transition`, `assign`, `archive`, `clone`, `comment create`) accept **one of** these target selectors:

| Selector            | When to use                                                                 |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--key KEY-1,KEY-2` | You already know the exact keys (the common DEV case — you have a UPEX-XXX) |
| `--jql "..."`       | You want everything matching a JQL query (sweeps, bulk transitions)         |
| `--filter 10001`    | You want to reuse a saved Jira filter                                       |
| `--from-file f`     | You have a file listing keys (`archive`/`unarchive`/`assign`)               |

When the selector matches many items, the command is **a batch operation**. Two flags almost always matter:

- `-y, --yes` — skip the interactive confirmation prompt. Required in CI; if omitted the command hangs waiting on stdin. **Note:** this flag does NOT exist on `admin user delete` / `admin user cancel-delete` (use `--ignore-errors` there instead).
- `--ignore-errors` — do not abort the batch when a single item fails.

## Output and piping

All list/search/view commands support three shapes:

- default table (human-readable)
- `--json` (for `jq` / scripts)
- `--csv` (spreadsheet-friendly)

Example pipe patterns:

```bash
# Count only — how many stories are still in "In Progress"?
acli jira workitem search --jql "project = UPEX AND status = 'In Progress'" --count

# Save a sprint snapshot to CSV
acli jira workitem search --jql "project = UPEX AND sprint in openSprints()" --paginate --csv > sprint.csv

# Extract a single field with jq (story summary for the impl-plan header)
acli jira workitem view UPEX-123 --json | jq '.fields.summary'
```

The JSON shape from `workitem search` has a top-level `issues` array (not `workitems`) — the Jira REST v3 wire format shows through.

## Publishing rich text (the default workflow)

Jira stores rich-text content (descriptions, comments, and any rich-text field) as **ADF — Atlassian Document Format**, a JSON tree of typed nodes (`heading`, `paragraph`, `bulletList`, `orderedList`, `codeBlock`, `blockquote`, `rule`) with inline marks (`strong`, `em`, `code`, `link`, `strike`).

`acli` accepts ADF JSON in every rich-text input. `acli` **never** converts markdown — passing `# Heading` to `--description` or `--body` stores the literal string `# Heading` wrapped in a single ADF paragraph.

To publish anything richer than plain prose, use this three-step workflow by default:

```
1. Author the content in Markdown.
2. Convert MD → ADF JSON using scripts/md-to-adf.ts.
3. Pass the ADF JSON to the matching acli flag — or, for cases acli cannot cover, into a REST body.
```

### The bundled converter

Location: `.claude/skills/acli/scripts/md-to-adf.ts`. Runtime: Bun.

CLI usage:

```bash
bun .claude/skills/acli/scripts/md-to-adf.ts input.md output.adf.json
# stdin form
cat input.md | bun .claude/skills/acli/scripts/md-to-adf.ts - output.adf.json
# stdout form (omit output arg)
bun .claude/skills/acli/scripts/md-to-adf.ts input.md > output.adf.json
```

Programmatic usage (when batching across many fields or many work items in one script):

```typescript
import { mdToAdf } from "./.claude/skills/acli/scripts/md-to-adf.ts";
const adf = mdToAdf(markdownString);  // returns { type: "doc", version: 1, content: [...] }
```

**Covered markdown subset**: headings 1–6, bullet lists, ordered lists, fenced code blocks (with optional language tag), inline code, bold, italic (snake_case-safe), strikethrough, links, blockquotes, horizontal rule, paragraphs.

**Out of scope** (extend the converter if your project needs them): nested lists, tables, mentions, panels, status macros, expand blocks, media / images.

### Recipe by Jira surface

| Surface | How to publish ADF | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `description` on `workitem create` | `--from-json` payload, `description` key holds an ADF doc | Custom-field values live in `additionalAttributes` of the same payload, same ADF shape |
| `description` on `workitem edit` | `--description-file <file>` accepts a JSON file containing an ADF doc | `acli` auto-detects ADF vs plain text by file content |
| Rich-text custom field on `workitem create` | `additionalAttributes.customfield_NNNNN` = ADF doc inside `--from-json` | Same shape as `description` |
| Rich-text custom field on an existing item | REST `PUT /rest/api/3/issue/{KEY}` with `{"fields": {customfield_NNNNN: <ADF>}}` | `acli workitem edit` does not cover custom fields — see gotcha #4 |
| Comment create | `comment create --body-file <file>` (alias `-F`) accepts ADF | The `--body` (plain) flag remains plain text only |
| Comment update | `comment update --body-adf <file>` | Dedicated ADF flag |

### Worked end-to-end example

```bash
# 1. Author each rich-text field as Markdown
cat > /tmp/desc.md <<'MD'
## User Story

- As a user
- I want X
- So that Y

## Context

Some context paragraph with **bold** and `inline_code`.
MD

cat > /tmp/ac.md <<'MD'
## Scenario: happy path

Given a valid input
When the user submits
Then the response is 200 OK
MD

# 2. Convert each MD file to ADF JSON
bun .claude/skills/acli/scripts/md-to-adf.ts /tmp/desc.md /tmp/desc.adf.json
bun .claude/skills/acli/scripts/md-to-adf.ts /tmp/ac.md   /tmp/ac.adf.json

# 3. Splice the ADF docs into the create-from-json payload
jq -n \
  --arg pk "EXAMPLE" \
  --slurpfile desc /tmp/desc.adf.json \
  --slurpfile ac   /tmp/ac.adf.json \
  '{
    projectKey: $pk,
    type: "Story",
    summary: "Example summary",
    description: $desc[0],
    labels: ["example"],
    additionalAttributes: {
      customfield_NNNNN: $ac[0]
    }
  }' > /tmp/story.json

# 4. Submit
acli jira workitem create --from-json /tmp/story.json --json
```

### Batch pattern (many work items, many rich fields)

When the task is to populate N work items with M rich-text fields each, the converter scales linearly with negligible overhead. Recommended pattern:

1. Write one generator script (`generate.ts`) that holds the per-field Markdown content for every item as inline string literals.
2. The script imports `mdToAdf` and converts every field in-process — no shell hop per conversion.
3. The script writes one `create --from-json` payload per item (`/tmp/item-N.json`).
4. A shell loop runs `acli jira workitem create --from-json /tmp/item-N.json --json` per file, capturing the new key from stdout.
5. For comments, follow the same approach: write the comment Markdown inline, convert in-process, post with `acli jira workitem comment create -k <KEY> -F /tmp/comment-N.adf.json`.

This pattern scales cleanly to dozens of items in one run. The bottleneck is authoring quality, not the conversion mechanic.

### Editing a custom-field value after create — REST fallback

`acli workitem edit` does not expose custom-field input (gotcha #4). To update a rich-text custom field on an existing item:

```bash
bun .claude/skills/acli/scripts/md-to-adf.ts /tmp/new.md /tmp/new.adf.json
jq -n --slurpfile adf /tmp/new.adf.json \
  '{fields: {customfield_NNNNN: $adf[0]}}' > /tmp/put.json
curl -s -w "\nHTTP %{http_code}\n" \

### Why this is the default

- Authoring in Markdown is fast, reviewable in pull requests, diffable.
- The conversion is deterministic — the same Markdown always produces the same ADF tree.
- One workflow covers every rich-text surface uniformly: descriptions, comments, custom fields, all the same three steps.
- Identifier-heavy prose (snake_case, kebab-case) survives the conversion because the italic detection has word-boundary guards.

## Five gotchas to keep in mind always

1. **`--paginate` is opt-in.** Default limit is server-side (30–50 depending on command). No warning on truncation. If you are counting, iterating, or making decisions based on the result, pass `--paginate`.
2. **Custom fields on `workitem create` go through `additionalAttributes` in `--from-json`.** Numeric IDs only (`customfield_10122`), no name-addressing. Documented value shapes in the `create` template are: `{"value": "..."}` (single-select), bare number, bare string. **`workitem edit` does NOT document custom-field input** — for editing custom-field values on existing items, fall back to REST/MCP. See `references/workitem.md` and `references/gotchas.md`.
3. **`acli` cannot enumerate custom fields.** `acli jira field` only does create/update/delete/cancel-delete. To discover field IDs, use `workitem view --json | jq` against an item that has the field set, or call `GET /rest/api/3/field` directly. There is no in-CLI listing. In this boilerplate, `bun run jira:sync-fields` writes the canonical map to `.agents/jira-fields.json` — reference fields by slug via `{{jira.<slug>}}` instead of hardcoding numeric IDs.
4. **Transitions match by status name, not transition ID.** When two transitions lead to the same status with different validators, the CLI picks one and may fail. No `--transition-id` escape hatch exists — fall back to REST if this hits.
5. **Trace IDs are the only debug signal.** An `unexpected error, trace id: XXXXXXXX` line is all you get on backend failures. Capture and log the trace ID always; Atlassian Support needs it.

## Top-level utilities

Quick-reference for the top-level surface that doesn't fit under a product. None of these need a separate reference file — they're documented here in full.

### `acli completion` — shell autocompletion

```bash
acli completion bash       > /etc/bash_completion.d/acli
acli completion zsh        > "${fpath[1]}/_acli"
acli completion fish       > ~/.config/fish/completions/acli.fish
acli completion powershell > acli.ps1
```

Each subcommand prints a shell script to stdout. Pipe to the location your shell expects (above are the conventional paths).

### `acli feedback` — report a problem to Atlassian

```bash
acli feedback \
  --summary "JSON shape on edit --generate-json is misleading" \
  --details "The template doesn't include additionalAttributes for custom fields..." \
  --email "you@example.com" \
  --time "1h" \
  --attachments error.log,trace.txt
```

Flags: `-s, --summary`, `-d, --details`, `-e, --email`, `-t, --time` (estimated timeframe like `1h`, `15m`), `-a, --attachments` (multiple files).

### `acli auth` — global OAuth (newer surface)

A top-level OAuth login that authenticates across products in one step. Distinct from per-product `jira auth` / `admin auth` / `confluence auth`. Use the per-product login for token-based CI; use the global one for interactive multi-product browsing.

```bash
acli auth login           # interactive OAuth
acli auth status
acli auth switch
acli auth logout
```

See `references/auth.md` for the full auth model.

### `acli config gov-cloud` — Atlassian Government Cloud

```bash
acli config gov-cloud --enable
acli config gov-cloud --status
```

Niche — only relevant if your org is on Atlassian Government Cloud. Not used in standard commercial Jira/Confluence.

## Navigation — when to load which reference

Load the reference that matches the user's current need. Do not preload all of them.

| Publish rich text to descriptions, comments, or custom fields                                                   | Inline section "Publishing rich text" + `scripts/md-to-adf.ts` |

## Working style

- **Default to Markdown authoring for any rich-text field.** Never pass raw markdown to `--description`, `--body`, or any custom-field value — `acli` does not convert markdown. Use `scripts/md-to-adf.ts` to produce ADF, then pass the JSON. See "Publishing rich text" above.
- **Prefer API-token auth in scripted contexts.** `--web` / OAuth is for humans at a terminal.
- **Always pass `--yes` in CI** for any mutating command (where the flag exists).
- **Always pass `--paginate`** when a downstream script consumes the result.
- **Scaffold complex payloads with `--generate-json`** (create, edit, project create, project update, link create, create-bulk). Pipe to a file, edit, submit with `--from-json`. Note: `--generate-json` is **static** — it does NOT introspect the actual project schema, so for custom-field shapes you may need to view a real item.
- **Capture the trace ID on any failure** and surface it when reporting to the user.
- **Do not invent flags.** When unsure, run `acli <path> --help` — it is authoritative and version-pinned to the installed binary. Convention: every multi-word flag is **kebab-case** (`--from-json`, `--searcher-key`, `--filter-id`, `--order-by`). camelCase variants will fail.
- **Verify subcommand existence before assuming.** Unknown subcommands silently fall back to parent help with exit 0 — they do NOT error. Read the help body, don't trust the exit code.
- **Know what `acli` cannot do.** All of the following require REST or MCP — `acli` does not cover them as of v1.3.18:
  - Enumerate custom fields (`field` has no `list`).
  - Edit custom-field values on existing work items (`workitem edit` does not document custom-field input).
  - Manage workflows, workflow schemes, statuses, or transition definitions.
  - Manage issue types, priorities, resolutions, project versions, project components.
  - Add a work item to a sprint (`JRACLOUD-97107`).
  - Upload attachments, add watchers.
  - Retrieve the cached auth token for reuse in another tool.
  - Bitbucket operations (out of scope entirely).
  - Confluence page CRUD beyond `page view` (as of v1.3.18 — space and blog have full CRUD).

  See `references/gotchas.md` for the full list with REST recipes.

## Installation (reference only)

Users usually already have `acli` installed. If not, point them at:

- Official guide: https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/acli/guides/install-acli/
- macOS: `brew tap atlassian/homebrew-acli && brew install acli`
- Linux (Debian/Ubuntu): `apt install acli` (after adding the Atlassian apt repo)
- Linux (RHEL/Fedora): `yum install acli` (after adding the Atlassian yum repo)
- Windows: PowerShell `curl` install (no Chocolatey/MSI yet)
- CI one-liner (Linux): `curl -LO "https://acli.atlassian.com/linux/1.3.18/acli_linux_amd64/acli" && chmod +x acli`

Pin to a version URL in production pipelines — `latest/` has caused same-day mass failures. Each release is supported for six months. Run `acli --version` to check.
