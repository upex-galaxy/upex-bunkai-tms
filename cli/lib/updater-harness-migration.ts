/**
 * @fileoverview One-time preflight that migrates a Claude-only consumer repo to the
 * cross-harness layout, BEFORE `runUpdate` syncs a single component.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * ---------------
 * The boilerplate used to keep its instructions in `CLAUDE.md`, its skills in
 * `.claude/skills/` and its personality hook in `.claude/hooks/`. It now keeps
 * instructions in `AGENTS.md` (which OpenCode and Codex read natively), skills in
 * `.agents/skills/` and the hook emitter in `.agents/hooks/`, with `.claude/skills`
 * reduced to a generated, gitignored alias and `CLAUDE.md` to a one-line `@AGENTS.md`
 * shim. Without this preflight, `bun run up` on a repo scaffolded before that change
 * is DESTRUCTIVE, in three compounding ways:
 *
 *   1. `CLAUDE.md` holds the project's own AI memory (identity, env URLs, custom
 *      rules). Nothing else knows that content exists: the sync never delivers an
 *      `AGENTS.md` (it is on the protected watchlist, never synced), so the repo
 *      ends up with a shim pointing at a file that does not exist and NO
 *      instructions at all.
 *   2. `.claude/skills/` is not in `deprecatedFiles`, so the project keeps its old
 *      tree while also receiving `.agents/skills/`. Two diverging copies of every
 *      skill, and `repairClaudeSkillsAlias` then refuses to touch a real directory,
 *      which fails the compatibility hook on every subsequent run.
 *   3. Git refuses every index entry behind a symlink (`is beyond a symbolic link`),
 *      so a repo that committed `.claude/skills/*` cannot `git add` or stash once
 *      the alias exists, which breaks lint-staged and the whole pre-commit hook.
 *
 * WHAT IT GUARANTEES
 * ------------------
 * Nothing is deleted. Content either MOVES to its canonical home or is preserved
 * under `.template/pre-agents-migration/`. The pass is idempotent: an already
 * migrated repo plans zero actions. If any single item cannot be resolved without
 * guessing, the whole migration refuses rather than half-applying.
